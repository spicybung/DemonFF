## Introduction

DemonFF is a neat little fork of DragonFF made to further enhance your workflow for working with Renderware files, and more. Whether you're working with GTA game assets - or it happens to be another Renderware game, DemonFF simplifies the process of importing and exporting many RW types such as DFF files, as well as .IFP animation, and map editing(IPL/IDE/PWN/LUA).



## Features

- **Renderware File Compatibility**: DemonFF is planned to work with all Renderware DFF files, offering support for various versions and features.

- **Export and Import**: Easily export your Blender models, maps, etc and import existing DFF files into Blender for further editing.

- **Collision Editing**: Streamline collision model editing whether your workload is large or small, as well as importing and exporting.

- **Animation Editing**: Import and export .IFP animation files - modify them or craft your own animations.

- **Map Editing**: Easily import your IPL & IDE's - create & export your own maps for singleplayer and/or SAMP/open.mp.

- **Rockstar Section IDs**: DemonFF supports Rockstar's Renderware section IDs, allowing you to work with R* Renderware files seamlessly.

- **SAMP/open.mp Compatibility**: DemonFF is designed for compatibility with San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP) as well as open.mp, and comes with Pawn features.
  
- **MTA Compatibility**: DemonFF is planned to support LUA scripts for Multi Theft Auto, allowing ease during map creation(SOON...).
