## Introduction

DemonFF is a neat little fork of DragonFF made to enhance your workflow by providing advanced features for working with Renderware files. Whether you're working with GTA game assets - or it happens to be another Renderware game, DemonFF simplifies the process of importing and exporting many RW types such as DFF files, as well as .IFP animation, and map editing(IPL/IDE/PWN/LUA).



## Features

- **Renderware File Compatibility**: DemonFF is planned to work with all Renderware DFF files, offering support for various versions and features.

- **Export and Import**: Easily export your Blender models, maps, etc and import existing DFF files into Blender for further editing.

- **Collision Editing**: Streamline collision model editing whether your workload is large or small, as well as importing and exporting.

- **Animation Editing**: Import and export .IFP animation files from Grand Theft Auto, and modify them or create your own.

- **Map Editing**: Easily import your IPL & IDE's, and create your own map for singleplayer and/or SAMP/open.mp.

- **Custom Section IDs**: DemonFF supports Rockstar's custom section IDs, allowing you to work with specific RW plugins seamlessly.
